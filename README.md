# Deep Learning Image Classification: A Comparative Study

##Overview

This project is a comprehensive investigation into deep learning models for image classification. We focus on the performances of pre-trained ResNet50, a custom-trained EfficientNetB0, and an EfficientNetB0 fine-tuned via transfer learning, aiming to provide clarity into the field of deep learning for image classification.


## Data

Our dataset encompasses ten distinct classes for training and validation. Detailed class distribution can be found in our project report.
The dataset used in this project is quite large (1.46GB) and is not included in this repository. However, if you wish to access the dataset, you can download it from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g1i1d4lElcQVft1WqJlEr5gGxcdioNzC/view?usp=sharing) 


## Installation & Usage
Ensure you have Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.10, and other necessary libraries installed. Clone this repository, navigate to the project directory and run the scripts for training and validation. Make sure to adjust the paths in the code where your dataset resides.
